## Happiness ? Where can I get it ?
Before coming to Japan, sometimes without a reason I used to feel depressed. I couldn't understand why, this continued in my initial days even after joining Mercari. Somedays I used to be happy while working and somedays without any reason I used to be dull. I want to get away from this so that it can help my day-to-day work more better, I used to think myself; "Is there any shop where I could buy happiness ?"

The answer to my questions to live a satisfied and happy life in-and-out of office came from many discussions with Japanese people and understanding few things from their life style. Today, I would like to share them with you all. The next 9 points really helped me alot.

1. Do not compare with others
2. Always keep promises
3. Keep doing many things, but do one at a time
4. Always keep learning
5. Be healthy. Your body is most important thing in this world.
6. Live in the moment. Don't get struck in the past or future.
7. Don't give excuses and you are responsible for your life.
8. Always be humble in whatever position you are in.
9. Plan your day before you take any action.
