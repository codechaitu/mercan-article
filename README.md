# Happiness ? Where can I get it ?
Before coming to Japan, sometimes without a reason I used to feel depressed. I couldn't understand why, this continued in my initial days even after joining Mercari. Some days I used to be happy while working and some days without any reason, I used to be dull. I want to get away from this, so that it can help my day-to-day work more. I used to think to myself; "Is there any place where I could buy happiness ?"

The answer to my questions to live a satisfied and happy life in-and-out of office, came from discussions with Japanese people and understanding a few things from their lifestyle. Today, I would like to share them with you. The next 9 points really helped me alot.

1. Do not compare with others.
	Comparing with others can make oneself down sometimes. We don’t know what the other person is going through. Always compare yourself, if you feel you are getting better than yourself from last day, then you are going great. 
2. Always keep promises.
	Promise means trust, which every human being has to up-hold with. If you can’t keep-up the promise, better tell the other person about it. Never ever give someone false hopes. This will make you feel bad about yourself at a later point of time.
3. Keep doing many things, but do one thing at a time.
	Human brain loves thinking. By default it tends to think negative about anything, fear or anxiety comes with this negative thinking. To overcome it, keep a to-do list and try to complete it, but do it one thing at a time, so that you can focus better.
4. Always keep learning.
	Learning doesn’t end at University, it starts from University. You can learn anything, any new thing you learn will definitely give a positive impact/attitude towards your life.
5. Your body is the most important thing in this world for you, so be healthy.
	Give the first priority to your body. If your body is not in good condition, it’s difficult to do other things. Remember, a sound body is a sound mind.
6. Live in the moment. Don't get struck in the past or future.
	Generally we tend to stick to the incidents that happened in the past or anxious about things that are going to happen in future. Either of them aren’t in our hands at-the-moment, so enjoy this present situation.
7. You are responsible for your life.
	You are the most important person to yourself, so be responsible for your thoughts and actions. 
8. Always be humble in whatever position you are in.
	Growing heights in a career is a great thing, and don’t forget to be humble. Both are a deadly combination. 
9. Plan your day before you take any action.
	Planning what you're going to do the next day, will help in doing things better and organized.




These are not complete list of things, but following them really helped me.
